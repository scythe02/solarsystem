    <h1>What is Mercury</h1>
    <P>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and also the smallest planet in the solar system.<br> The small and cratered planet does not have any moons and zips around the sun faster than any other planet in the solar system, hence why the Romans named it after their swift-footed messenger god.</P>
